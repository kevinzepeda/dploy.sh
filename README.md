# `dploy`: AI-Powered CI/CD Automation

`dploy`is an AI-assisted CI/CD solution designed to simplify continuous integration and deployment workflows. By leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze your codebase, `dploy` automatically generates optimal CI/CD configurations across multiple platforms.

## Project Vision

Our mission is to eliminate the complexity of CI/CD setup and maintenance, allowing developers to focus on writing code while `dploy` handles the deployment pipeline. The solution is especially valuable for projects using AI-generated code, providing seamless versioning and deployment capabilities.

## Components

`dploy` consists of two main components:

1. **dploy.sh** - Web Platform
   - User registration and management
   - Dashboard for metrics and configuration visualization
   - Subscription management and billing system

2. **dploy CLI** - Command Line Interface
   - AI-powered code analysis
   - Automatic CI/CD configuration generation
   - Multi-platform integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
   - Version management for AI-generated code

## Core Features

- **Code Analysis**: Automatically detect project structure, dependencies, and requirements
- **Platform Agnostic**: Generate configurations for multiple CI/CD platforms
- **Version Control**: Special handling for AI-generated code versions
- **One-Command Deployment**: Simplify complex CI/CD setup with a single command

## Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Research existing CI/CD platforms and their APIs
- Design system architecture and database structure
- Select technologies and frameworks
- Create internal API specifications
- Set up development environment

### Phase 2: Basic MVP (Weeks 4-9)
- Develop core authentication system in Web66
- Implement basic CLI with `init` and basic code analysis
- Support GitHub Actions as first CI/CD platform
- Create initial API between Web66 and CLI
- Internal testing with sample projects

### Phase 3: Enhanced MVP (Weeks 10-15)
- Add metrics dashboard to Web66
- Implement payment processing
- Enhance CLI with Git integration
- Add support for additional CI/CD platforms
- Implement full `plan` and `deploy` functionality
- Improve AI code analysis capabilities
- Beta testing with 5-10 initial users

### Phase 4: Initial Release (Weeks 16-18)
- Finalize documentation and user guides
- Implement fixes based on beta tester feedback
- Set up scalable infrastructure
- Prepare marketing materials
- Launch to public with free tier

## CLI Commands

```bash
dploy init                  # Initial setup and authentication
dploy plan <path>           # Analyze code and generate CI/CD plan without execution
dploy save-version <name>   # Save and tag specific version of the code
dploy deploy <path>         # Implement CI/CD plan on configured platform

dploy                       # Execute an agent to analize de context and run the Command with correct options
```

## Value Proposition

- **Time Savings**: Reduce CI/CD setup from hours to minutes
- **Expertise Gap**: Get professional CI/CD configurations without specialized knowledge
- **AI Integration**: Perfect companion for projects using AI code generation tools
- **Platform Flexibility**: Switch between CI/CD platforms with minimal effort
